		</p>

		<p>12/?/19 Iced Philz Ambrosia, Medium/Medium Plus - unremarkable
		</p>
		<p>11/9/19 Iced Philz Ambrosia, Medium/Medium Plus - still the feeling that it's thin after being so used to lattes, but solid and buttery after I got over it. Still a pleasure to drink.

		</p>
		<p>9/10/19 Latte from Bien Cuit - shallow; well-balanced but unnotable coffee
