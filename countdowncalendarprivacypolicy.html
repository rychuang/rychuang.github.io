    <h1>Privacy Policy for Calendar Countdown Chrome Extension</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 1, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Calendar Countdown</strong>, a Google Chrome extension designed to help you track important events and deadlines directly in your browser. Your privacy is critically important to us, and this policy outlines how we handle your information.</p>

    <p>By using Calendar Countdown, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Calendar Countdown does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or sensitive user data.</strong> The extension operates entirely locally on your device, and no data is harvested, shared, or sent to external servers.</p>

    <h3>User-Provided Data</h3>
    <p>The only information handled by the extension is the data you voluntarily input, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Event names</li>
        <li>Dates and times for countdowns</li>
        <li>Optional notes or descriptions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored exclusively on your device and is never accessed by us or any third party.</p>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Data</h3>
    <p>The extension does not use cookies, analytics tools, or tracking technologies.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data created or managed through Calendar Countdown (e.g., events, settings) is stored locally on your device using Chrome's <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API or similar browser storage mechanisms. This data remains under your control and is never transmitted externally.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>While no digital storage is 100% secure, we rely on Google Chrome's built-in security protocols to protect locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Calendar Countdown does not integrate with third-party services, APIs, or servers. Your data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requests the following Chrome permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>storage</strong>: To save your countdown events locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>alarms</strong>: To trigger countdown notifications (if enabled).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No additional permissions are required, and none of these permissions are used to access your personal data or browsing activity.</p>

    <h2>5. User Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access/Modify Data</strong>: View, edit, or delete events directly within the extension's interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete All Data</strong>: Uninstalling the extension will remove all locally stored data. You may also manually clear data via Chrome's extension settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Calendar Countdown does not target or knowingly collect data from users under the age of 13. The extension complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Significant changes will be communicated via the Chrome Web Store listing or within the extension interface. Your continued use of Calendar Countdown after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
